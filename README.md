#   BasicBank
 
Welcome to our Banking System.

To correctly run this program, import the project into eclipse on any computer, navigate to the 'Bank' class, and run the 
main method there. Once that's done, you can simply follow the instructions in the console to do whatever you wish to.

Please note:

If you do not want to run into our custom exceptions, you will have to ensure that inputs such as "overdraft option" are 
*exactly* correct. For other exceptions, you can look through the code and see what triggers them, although more are 
intuitive. Basically, give a valid input to not run into an exception. 

Please be sure to copy each account number it gives you, as that is what you will need to provide to use the methods. 
We were not able to save the files beyond the main method, so everything will have to be done on a single run of the main 
method. 

After each run of the main, a unique save log will be saved into the project folder.

Thank you for reading, enjoy.
